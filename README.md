# Overview
Uncapped Enchantment Levels in the Anvil and No Enchantment Conflicts.

The [Gallery](https://modrinth.com/mod/enchantments-unbound/gallery) has some screenshots.

## No Enchantment Conflicts
- Mending + Infinity
- Protection + Blast Protection
- Sharpness + Smite
- Looting on Tridents
- etc...
  
## No Enchantment Level Cap
Sharpness 75? Go for it!

This mod does not modify the vanilla behavior of enchantments, so some will not scale, while others get a little crazy at high levels.

## Balancing
Any combination that the mod handles costs 39 levels (customizable in the config .json)
However, high levels naturally get expensive/tedious.

Sharpness VI = 2 Sharpness V (1x 39 levels)

Sharpness VII = 2 Sharpness VI = 4 Sharpness V (3x 39 levels)

Sharpness VIII = 2 Sharpness VII... 8 Sharpness V (7x 39 levels)

# Dependencies
### ðŸ“œ [Fabric API](https://modrinth.com/mod/fabric-api)
Enchantments Unbound must be installed on the **server-side** (can be singleplayer)

If you join a server that has this mod installed but do not have it clientside, you will probably want a [Texture Pack](https://www.planetminecraft.com/texture-pack/enchantment-level-fix/) to fix high levels displaying incorrectly. If you have the mod clientside, it will handle this for you.
